Limitations of our estimates: people who aren't U.S. citizens aren't eligible to vote; people convicted of felonies in prison are not eligible to vote either (https://election.lab.ufl.edu/voter-turnout/2022-general-election-turnout/ has the numbers for the state of Maryland) but it's hard to estimate that at the precinct, ward, legislative district level, so we just use Maryland's voting-age population (adjusted for prison gerrymandering) to estimate the population of eligible voters in any precinct in Baltimore City.
